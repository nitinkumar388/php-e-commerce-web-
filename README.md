## About System

Admin has full control of the system, he/she can view daily/monthly sales report for each year, manage all existing users, add, view, edit, delete products and categories. Monthly sales report is represented in the form of Bar Graphs. While adding products, the admin has to provide Product’s name, select category, price, upload product’s photo and write a description. Adding a product category is simple, the admin just has to provide Category name. Just like the other popular e-commerce, here while looking a product’s image the images magnifies whenever mouse cursor is dragged onto it. The system redirects to Paypal for checkout. A responsive dashboard is provided in the admin panel for the easy management of the site.

All the important features that are required for an eCommerce site is set for this project. Design of this project is pretty simple and responsive so that user won’t find it difficult to understand, use and navigate.
